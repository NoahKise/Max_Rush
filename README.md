# Objective

* You are Max Rush, and you missed your alarm this morning! You need to catch the bus, but you only have 55 seconds to do so. Run through the streets of Portland, and make sure to collect at least 28 coins along the way- otherwise, you can't aford the fare! Collect all 50 coins for style points to attain a day pass.

# Controls

* Run-:`A` for left, `D` for right.
* Jump: `SPACE BAR`.
* Double Jump: `SPACE BAR` (While in the air after an initial jump. Exiting a ladder counts as an initial jump, bouncing on a tree top also counts as an initial jump).
* Slide: `S`.
* Climb Ladder: `W` (While in ladder zone).
* Descend Ladder: `S` (While in ladder zone).

# Obstacles

* When you get too close to a dog it will follow you until you exit its proximity. While in its proximity, you will be slowed down, as you simply can't help petting the dog.
* When you run through a cup of coffee, you will gain a momentary speed boost.
* If a car is in your way, you can jump on top of it to crush it.
* You can bounce on tree tops by simply landing on top of them.
* If you can't jump over an obstacle, you may need to slide under it.
* When you reach the bus, wait in front of the door for the driver to let you on.
